The button and switch have individual counters for the number of times they've been "used"
	Once the combined count reaches 10 the scene "ends" and the player is player is prompted to restart the scene or end the application
		The switch does not actually "restart" the scene. It resets the elements within the scene to a "starting state", except for the switch
	When the prompt appears on screen it covers up the coin. Maybe the coin is still there? The rest of the scene becomes uninteractable
	The panel likely blocks raycasts and is positioned in front of the rest of the scene.


The button makes the coin begin to spin
	The button can just change a speed variable from 0 to 1

The switch changes the direction that the button spins
	The switch could do this by toggling another variable between -1 and 1
	The switch changes the state back and forth on a 3 second timer
		The switch changes based on if the mouse position is "notably" higher when the click is released
			The mouse does not need to be positioned on the switch when the mouse is released for the switch to be affected

The coin is likely self driving with an update that changes its rotation by a specific rate each frame
	The coin pulls from a some variables that the switch and the button have control over

The end scene script is probably referenced as part of an event call rather than as part of an Update method

The canvas does not scale with the size of the player
